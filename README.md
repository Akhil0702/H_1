## Results Summary
- Function approximation: θ=(0.5,1) fits better than θ=(1,0)
- Random guessing is inefficient compared to gradient descent
- Gradient descent iterations reduce error consistently
- Random guessing can sometimes outperform the very first GD step, but GD converges reliably
- Underfitting vs Overfitting identified and fixes suggested
- Gradient descent converged to same solution as closed-form regression
